# BottleLogic - Console-Based Recycling System

BottleLogic is a console-based application written in Java, designed to simulate the collection and ecological processing of plastic bottles and aluminum cans. This project represents my first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application in Java.

## Key Features:
- **Simulated Recycling Process:** Users can "insert" bottles and cans, which are validated and processed according to predefined rules.
- **Eco-Friendly Design:** Items that meet specific requirements are accepted, compressed, and their refund value is calculated.
- **Receipt Simulation:** The console output mimics a printed receipt, including details such as the number of items recycled, the total refund, and additional instructions. This mirrors the experience of real-world recycling machines.

## About This Version:
This project is my personalized implementation of a concept that already exists in recycling machines. It serves as an educational exercise to explore OOP principles and simulate real-world functionality.
